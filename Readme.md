# **Movies Website (Backend)**

This is the Backend API for my movies' website.

This API allows for the retrieval of movie data from 'movie-api-db' which is my MongoDB database

This API also allows for a POST request that will POST a movie review sent to 'localhost:8080/api/v1/reviews'. The review is then stored in 'movie-api-db' database.
